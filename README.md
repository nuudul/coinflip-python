# coinflip-python
A (really shitty) coin-flip script written in python

## How it works
The user enters either 1 (for ```True```) or 2 (for ```False```)

then the variable ```x``` gets declared with a random number betweem 1 and 100 (100 included)

if the number is even (if the remainder of x/2 is 0), the value of ```coin``` is ```True```
if the number is odd (if the remainder of x/2 is 1), the value  of ```coin``` is ```False```

then the user input (```useropt```) and ```coin``` gets compared

if they are the same, it prints "Correct", if not, it prints "Wrong"

also I could not use functions (other than ```coinflip```) since i cant use the variables outside the function

this script is fucking awful
